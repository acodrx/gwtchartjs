 * Scatter charts are based on basic line charts with the x axis changed to a
 * linear axis. To use a scatter chart, data must be passed as objects
 * containing X and Y properties. The example below creates a scatter chart with
 * 3 points.<br>
 * <br>
 * The scatter chart supports all of the same properties as the line chart.
